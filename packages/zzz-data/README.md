# zzz-data

Typed data toolkit for Zenless Zone Zero. This package bundles curated JSON, enums, and interfaces so applications can consume the game encyclopedia without scraping or cleansing spreadsheets themselves.

## What You Get

- **Structured datasets** – JSON exports for agents, Bangboos, W-Engines, Drive Discs, anomalies, and Deadly Assaults under `./data`.
- **TypeScript surface** – `dist/index.d.ts` exposes discriminated unions, shared enums, and helper constants such as `ATTRIBUTES`, `SPECIALTIES`, and `ATTACK_TYPES`.
- **Stable identifiers** – Consistent keys generated from the workbook (`data.xlsx`) and Hakush scraping pipeline (`data-hakush`).

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add zzz-data
```

The package is workspace-linked here, but once published it can be installed like any other npm dependency. Node.js 20+ is recommended.

## Usage

```ts
import type { Agent } from "zzz-data"
import { agents, ATTRIBUTES } from "zzz-data"

type ElectricAgent = Agent & { attribute: typeof ATTRIBUTES.ELECTRIC }

const electricAgents: ElectricAgent[] = agents.filter(
  (agent): agent is ElectricAgent => agent.attribute === ATTRIBUTES.ELECTRIC,
)
```

Each resource (agents, bangboos, etc.) is exported as a strongly typed array. Constants live under `zzz-data/src/constants`, and the individual JSON files can be imported directly via the `./data/*` export map if you prefer raw objects.

## Scripts

| Command             | Purpose                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pnpm run scrape`   | Launch Puppeteer, crawl https://zzz3.hakush.in, and store fresh raw assets in `data-hakush`.     |
| `pnpm run generate` | Parse `data.xlsx` plus the scraped assets and regenerate the normalized JSON files under `data`. |
| `pnpm run build`    | Compile the TypeScript sources with tsdown into `dist` (JS + declaration files).                 |
| `pnpm run release`  | Publish the package (expects the correct registry auth to be configured).                        |

## Data Pipeline

1. **Source updates** – Refresh raw Hakush payloads with `pnpm run scrape` or edit `data.xlsx` manually for quick fixes.
2. **Normalize** – Run `pnpm run generate` to map localized strings to canonical keys, attach icons, and emit denormalized arrays.
3. **Ship** – Execute `pnpm run build` so consumers (including the server workspace package) see the updated exports in `dist`.

Intermediate artifacts generated by the scraper live in `data-hakush`; the distributable JSON lives in `data`. Check both directories into source control to keep provenance clear.

## Directory Layout

```
src/
  constants/      # ATTRIBUTES, SPECIALTIES, ATTACK_TYPES, FACTIONS
  types/          # Agent, Bangboo, W-Engine, Drive Disc, etc. definitions
  index.ts        # Aggregated exports for constants, types, and JSON data
scripts/
  scraper/        # Puppeteer + cheerio crawler for Hakush
  generate.ts     # ExcelJS workflow that regenerates JSON payloads
```

## Updating Content

- Prefer adding new columns or sheets to `data.xlsx` rather than hand-editing JSON.
- If the Hakush DOM changes, adjust the selectors in `scripts/scraper` and re-run `pnpm run scrape`.
- Keep PRs focused—include regenerated JSON alongside the source changes so reviewers can verify the pipeline output.
